/// intermediate peers to reach their destination. The envelope itself is not
/// encrypted, allowing relay nodes to inspect routing metadata (TTL, hop path,
/// destination) without accessing the actual message content.

/// Key security properties:
/// - The `encryptedPayload` is opaque to relay nodes (E2E encrypted)
/// - The `poolID` prevents cross-pool message injection attacks
/// - The `hopPath` enables loop detection to prevent infinite routing
/// - The `ttl` prevents messages from circulating indefinitely
