## Overview

ConnectionPool is a Swift package that builds a secure mesh network with two transport modes:

1. **Local mode** — MultipeerConnectivity over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. No internet required.
2. **Remote mode** — WebSocket transport via [StealthRelay](https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay), a self-hosted Rust relay server. Connect from anywhere.

Both modes enforce end-to-end encryption, authenticate joiners with pool codes or invitation tokens, and protect relay envelopes with HMAC-SHA256. The library was built for StealthOS, where "privacy by default" is not a feature — it is the architecture.

Zero external dependencies. Everything ships in one Swift package.

## Features

- **MultipeerConnectivity-based local P2P** — Discover and connect to nearby devices over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with Bonjour service advertising
- **Mesh networking with multi-hop relay** — Messages reach peers beyond direct radio range by hopping through intermediate nodes
- **BFS-based topology routing** — Shortest-path routing computed from a distributed neighbor map that each node broadcasts periodically
- **Relay envelope with TTL, loop prevention, and dedup** — Every relayed message carries a TTL counter, an ordered hop path for cycle detection, and a UUID checked against a bounded deduplication cache (10,000 entries, 5-minute expiry)
- **HMAC-SHA256 envelope integrity** — Routing metadata (origin, destination, pool ID, message ID, timestamp) is signed with a key derived via HKDF from the pool ID; tampered envelopes are dropped
- **DTLS encryption enforced on all sessions** — `MCEncryptionPreference.required` on every `MCSession` — primary and relay — so all data in transit is encrypted at the transport layer
- **Pool code authentication** — Hosts generate a join code that is never included in Bonjour discovery info; joiners send it as invitation context and the host validates it server-side before accepting
- **Brute-force protection with auto-blocking** — After 5 failed join attempts from the same device (within a 1-hour window), the device is permanently added to the block list
- **Per-peer rate limiting** — A 5-second cooldown between connection attempts from the same peer prevents invitation flooding
- **10 MB inbound message size limit** — Oversized payloads are dropped before decoding on both the primary and relay sessions
- **Separate relay service type** — Relay discovery uses a distinct Bonjour service type (`stealthos-rly`) to avoid DTLS handshake conflicts with the primary session
- **Persistent device block list** — Blocked devices survive app restarts; storage is pluggable via `BlockListStorageProvider` (defaults to `UserDefaults`, can be wired to encrypted storage)
- **Multiplayer game service** — Built-in session management for turn-based and real-time games: invitations, ready checks, state sync, forfeit handling, and disconnect recovery
- **Configurable logging via protocol injection** — Inject your own `ConnectionPoolLogger` at startup; falls back to Apple's `os.Logger` with per-category subsystems
- **App lifecycle protocol** — `PoolAppLifecycle` lets the host app suspend, resume, and terminate pool operations cleanly
- **Zero external dependencies** — Only Apple frameworks: `MultipeerConnectivity`, `CryptoKit`, `Combine`, `Foundation`, `os`

### Remote Relay Transport ([StealthRelay](https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay))

- **WebSocket transport** — Connect to a self-hosted relay server from anywhere via `wss://` (default) or `ws://` if explicitly specified
- **Ed25519 host authentication** — The host signs pool creation with a Keychain-stored Ed25519 identity
- **Invitation-based joining** — Shareable `stealth://invite/...` URLs with Ed25519 signatures, HMAC proofs, and configurable expiry
- **Proof-of-Work anti-DoS** — Joining peers solve a SHA-256 PoW challenge (18-bit difficulty, ~50ms) before the server forwards the request to the host
- **End-to-end encrypted relay messages** — Messages relayed via WebSocket are AES-GCM encrypted with a key derived from the pool shared secret via HKDF-SHA256; the relay server sees only opaque ciphertext
- **Session tokens** — All privileged operations (create invitation, kick peer, close pool) require a server-issued session token
- **TLS certificate pinning** — SPKI SHA-256 pin verification via custom `URLSessionDelegate`
- **Server claiming** — First-use server binding via QR code or manual claim code from Docker logs
- **Recovery key after claim** — After claiming a server, the recovery key is displayed in a dedicated sheet with options to save to the password manager or copy to clipboard; the user must acknowledge before proceeding
- **Automatic reconnection** — Exponential backoff with invitation expiry checks; previously-approved peers are auto-accepted on reconnect
- **Relay bridge deduplication** — Messages bridged between relay and primary sessions are deduplicated by `PoolMessage.id` to prevent double processing
- **1 MB WebSocket frame limit** — Incoming WebSocket frames exceeding 1 MB are dropped before processing to prevent memory exhaustion from malicious servers
- **Cloudflare Tunnel support** — Production deployment via `cloudflared` for TLS termination without managing certificates

## Security

Security is not bolted on — it is structural. Every layer enforces its own guarantees.

### Transport Encryption (DTLS)

All `MCSession` instances — both the primary session and the dedicated relay session — are created with `MCEncryptionPreference.required`. Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework performs a DTLS handshake before any application data is exchanged.

### Pool Code Authentication

Pool codes are **never** included in Bonjour discovery metadata. A joiner sends the code as part of the invitation context. The host validates it before calling the invitation handler. This prevents passive eavesdroppers from learning the code by observing Bonjour traffic.

### Brute-Force Protection

A global rate limiter tracks total wrong code attempts across all peers — 10 failures in 60 seconds triggers a 30-second cooldown. This cannot be bypassed by rotating peer identities. Per-peer tracking via `DeviceBlockListService` provides supplementary defense.

### Remote Relay Security ([StealthRelay](https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay))

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Host Authentication** | Ed25519 signature over `pool_id \|\| timestamp \|\| nonce` where nonce is a server-issued per-connection challenge; timestamp window tightened to 30 seconds |
| **E2E Relay Encryption** | AES-GCM encryption with a key derived from the pool shared secret via HKDF-SHA256 (`stealth-ws-encrypt` info); the relay server sees only opaque ciphertext |
| **Session Tokens** | 32-byte server-issued token required for all privileged operations from both host and guest peers; included in Forward frames for all roles (constant-time comparison) |
| **Invitation Tokens** | Ed25519-signed URLs with HMAC proof-of-possession, configurable expiry and max uses, `server_address` bound in signature |
| **Proof-of-Work** | SHA-256 hashcash (18-bit difficulty) required before join requests are forwarded to the host |
| **TLS Pinning** | SPKI SHA-256 hash pinning via `URLSessionDelegate` (optional, for production deployments) |
| **Server Claiming** | One-time claim code binds a server to a host identity; the code is destroyed after use |
| **Display Name Sanitization** | All display names are stripped of control characters, newlines, and truncated to 64 characters before logging or storage |
| **Per-Pool Isolation** | Pending joins, session tokens, and server URLs are all scoped per-pool — no cross-pool state leakage |

### Relay Envelope Integrity (HMAC-SHA256)

Every outgoing `RelayEnvelope` is signed with an HMAC computed over its immutable routing fields, each length-prefixed to prevent concatenation forgery:

- `originPeerID` (length-prefixed)
- `destinationPeerID` (length-prefixed)
- `poolID`
- `messageID`
- `maxTTL` (constant, not the mutable per-hop TTL)
- `timestamp`

The HMAC key is derived from a pool-level shared secret (not the pool UUID) using HKDF-SHA256. Verification uses CryptoKit's constant-time `isValidAuthenticationCode`. Envelopes without HMAC are rejected — no backwards-compatibility fallback.

### Loop and Amplification Prevention

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **TTL** (default 5, max 5) | Messages circulating indefinitely |
| **Hop path** | Relaying to a peer already in the path |
| **Deduplication cache** (10,000 entries, 5-min expiry) | Processing the same message twice |
| **Message expiry** (5 minutes) | Replay of old messages |
| **Pool ID validation** | Cross-pool message injection |
| **Topology broadcast freshness** (120s max age) | Replay of stale routing info |
| **Topology broadcast HMAC** (HMAC-SHA256) | Unsigned or tampered topology broadcasts are rejected when a pool shared secret is set |
| **WebSocket frame size limit** (1 MB) | Memory exhaustion from oversized frames sent by malicious servers |

### Inbound Size Limits

All received data — on both the primary `MCSessionDelegate` and the relay session delegate — is checked against a 10 MB hard limit before any decoding is attempted.

### Separate Relay Service Type

Relay discovery operates on a distinct Bonjour service type to prevent DTLS handshake state from colliding with the primary session. The relay session uses its own `MCSession`, `MCPeerID`, and delegate handler, fully isolated from the primary connection.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Olib-AI/ConnectionPool.git", from: "1.4.0")
]
```

Then add the dependency to your target:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourApp",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "ConnectionPool", package: "ConnectionPool")
        ]
    )
]
```

### Local Package (XcodeGen)

If using XcodeGen, add to your `project.yml`:

```yaml
packages:
  ConnectionPool:
    path: LocalPackages/ConnectionPool

targets:
  YourApp:
    dependencies:
      - package: ConnectionPool
        product: ConnectionPool
```

Then regenerate: `xcodegen generate`

## Quick Start

### Hosting a Pool

```swift
import ConnectionPool

let manager = ConnectionPoolManager.shared

// Configure logging (optional — falls back to os.Logger)
ConnectionPoolConfiguration.logger = MyAppLogger()

// Set user profile
manager.localProfile = PoolUserProfile(
    displayName: "Alice",
    avatarEmoji: "🦊",
    avatarColorIndex: 1
)

// Start hosting with a pool code
let config = PoolConfiguration(
    name: "My Room",
    maxPeers: 8,
    requireEncryption: true,
    generatePoolCode: true
)
manager.startHosting(configuration: config)

// The pool code is available after hosting starts
if let code = manager.currentSession?.poolCode {
    print("Share this code: \(code)")
}
```

### Joining a Pool

```swift
import ConnectionPool
import Combine

let manager = ConnectionPoolManager.shared
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

// Start browsing for nearby pools
manager.startBrowsing()

// Observe discovered pools
manager.$discoveredPeers
    .sink { peers in
        for peer in peers {
            print("Found: \(peer.effectiveDisplayName)")
        }
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)

// Join a discovered pool with the code
if let pool = manager.discoveredPeers.first {
    manager.joinPool(pool, poolCode: "ABC123")
}
```

### Sending and Receiving Messages

```swift
// Send a chat message to all peers
manager.sendChat("Hello, pool!")

// Send a typed message to specific peers
let message = PoolMessage.chat(
    from: manager.localPeerID,
    senderName: manager.localPeerName,
    text: "Direct message"
)
manager.sendMessage(message, to: ["peer-id-here"])

// Receive messages
manager.messageReceived
    .sink { message in
        switch message.type {
        case .chat:
            if let payload = message.decodePayload(as: ChatPayload.self) {
                print("\(message.senderName): \(payload.text)")
            }
        default:
            break
        }
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)

// Observe peer events
manager.peerEvent
    .sink { event in
        switch event {
        case .connected(let peer):
            print("\(peer.displayName) joined")
        case .disconnected(let peer):
            print("\(peer.displayName) left")
        }
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### Hosting a Remote Pool

```swift
import ConnectionPool

let viewModel = ConnectionPoolViewModel()

// Set the relay server URL and create the pool
viewModel.createRemotePool(serverURL: "10.0.0.4:9090")

// If the server is unclaimed, provide the claim code from Docker logs
viewModel.claimCode = "abcd-1234-..."
viewModel.submitClaimCode()

// Create an invitation link for others to join
viewModel.createRemoteInvitation(maxUses: 1, expiresInSecs: 300)

// The invitation URL is available via currentRemoteInvitation
if let invitation = viewModel.currentRemoteInvitation {
    print("Share this link: \(invitation.url)")
}
```

### Joining a Remote Pool

```swift
import ConnectionPool

let viewModel = ConnectionPoolViewModel()

// Join using an invitation URL
viewModel.invitationURLInput = "stealth://invite/..."
viewModel.joinViaInvitation()
```

### Disconnecting

```swift
manager.disconnect()
```

## Self-Hosting the Relay Server

The relay server is a standalone Rust project: [StealthRelay](https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay)

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
docker run -p 9090:9090 -p 127.0.0.1:9091:9091 ghcr.io/olib-ai/stealth-relay:latest

# With Docker Compose (recommended)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# With Cloudflare Tunnel (production)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
               -f docker/docker-compose.cloudflared.yml up -d
```

See the [StealthRelay README](https://github.com/Olib-AI/StealthRelay) for full deployment documentation.

## Configuration

### Injecting a Custom Logger

```swift
struct MyLogger: ConnectionPoolLogger {
    func log(
        _ message: String,
        level: PoolLogLevel,
        category: PoolLogCategory,
        file: String,
        function: String,
        line: Int
    ) {
        print("[\(level.rawValue)] [\(category.rawValue)] \(message)")
    }
}

// Set before using any ConnectionPool APIs
ConnectionPoolConfiguration.logger = MyLogger()
```

### Injecting Encrypted Block List Storage

```swift
struct SecureStorage: BlockListStorageProvider {
    func save(_ data: Data, forKey key: String) throws {
        // Write to Keychain or encrypted file
    }
    func load(forKey key: String) throws -> Data? {
        // Read from Keychain or encrypted file
    }
}

// Set at app startup
ConnectionPoolConfiguration.blockListStorageProvider = SecureStorage()
```

### Injecting Encrypted Remote Pool State Storage

```swift
// Same protocol as block list storage — reuse your SecureStorage implementation
ConnectionPoolConfiguration.remotePoolStateStorageProvider = SecureStorage()
```

When set, `RemotePoolState` persists through this provider instead of plain `UserDefaults`, preventing connection history (server URL, pool ID, host status) from being stored unencrypted.
